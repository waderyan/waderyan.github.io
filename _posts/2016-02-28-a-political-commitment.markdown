I consider it a great privilege to engage in the political debate and live my American heritage.

I come from one of the most conservative states in the United States of America. I voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. 
My parents, grandparents, friends, brothers, dogs, and cats are conservative. I feel cognitive ease when I hear conservative ideas. 
Basically, I bleed conservatism.

As you can see I am heavily biased, but I am lucky enough to realize it. I am committing now to attempt to see both sides of the issues. 
In the coming months, I plan on writing multiple posts exploring both sides of politically charged issues.

I want to see what liberals see in offering free public education, raising the minimum wage, and solving income inequality. 
I want to understand why national debt is bad (if it is) and what I should do about it. 
I want to learn how to raise children who flourish, help people out of poverty, and feed starving children. 
I want to understand the issues to understand the character of my politicians.

I commit to being an American by educating myself and disregarding the sound-bite nature of my society.
