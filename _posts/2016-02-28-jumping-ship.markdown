Sometimes you're not meant to continue riding the ship.

This is the reality for me with my startup. I worked for three years on [Novi Security](http://www.novisecurity.com) (nearly 18 months full-time) and have sadly hung up my cleats and moved to a new adventure.

Novi was a highlight in my life and i’ll never forget the many lessons I learned.

- Entrepreneurship is the noblest of missions.
- If you dream it and work your heart out, you’ll do some amazing things.
- The ecosystem startup is supportive, vibrant, and the heart and soul of the American dream.
- Grinding day in and day out is much tougher than you can imagine.
- Family is most important.

I left Novi because I needed more financial support for my family. My wife and I had our first son in July. We made it as far as we could.

I wish my friends at Novi the best of luck. They will be successful and I am grateful that I could play a small part in building the foundation.
