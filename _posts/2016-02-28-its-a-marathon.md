I am a sprinter. I vibe with sayings like "I'll sleep when I'm dead" and "run so hard you collapse at the finish line."
I sprint by working long hours, getting far ahead, and rarely taking time off. 

When I returned home from my LDS mission my dad encouraged me to slow down and relax. I ignored his advice. I had a good
mission because I did exactly the opposite. I worked hard everyday and sprinted through my two-year service. 

I continued to ignore the advice through college. Each semester I would sprint through the course work, getting ahead in all
my classes, and studying weeks in advance exams. During the break between semesters I would start the process all over again. 
Before school started I'd have two or three of the earliest assignments finished. 

This worked well for succeeding academically. I had great success. 

Then I started a company. Sprinting worked well in startup culture (for a time, keep reading). My peers were sprinters, working
long hours, checking email 24/7, and pushing hard through development "sprints" (ironic name now that I'm writing this article). 

I flourished to begin with. I was having a lot of fun and found my work life eventful and meaningful.

Then the grind started. If you haven't worked at a company in its earliest stages the grind might be hard to understand.
The grind is an unrelenting force. Its a weight you carry every day. You can't escape the grind and your own mental
will power will likely not be enough to overcome the negative forces of the grind. 

In hindsight, the grind started to negatively affect me one year into my startup. Low on personal cash and feeling the financial 
burden of starting a family, the grind began to take a toll. I began to lash out in a ways I wouldn't before. I would see negativity where I shouldn't 
and I struggled with tunnel vision when I desperately needed to innovate. 

The grind crushes sprinters. At least sprinters like me. I didn't take vacation. Even when I did take time off, 
I was never really away from my work. 

I didn't have the gusto to keep up the sprint. And for me I learned a valuable lesson: it's a marathon. You can survive some
parts of your life sprinting, but a career is a marathon. Everything is and should be a long-term play. 

Treat your relationships as long-term plays. This applies to your family, and also your
business and networking relationships.

Treat your work energy as a long-term play. I burned out. I ran out of gas and couldn't get to the finish line. 
My partners were better at handling the grind than me. They took time off and got away from the grind successfully.

Looking back I have regret about the sprinter's pace. I may have been able to put off the burn out much longer had
I had a better working pace.

Remember it's a marathon. Pace yourself.
