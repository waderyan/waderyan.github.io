# Innovator's DNA: Mastering the Five Skills of Disruptive Innovation

## Brief

Innovator's DNA (IDNA) is filled with specific actions to improve your innovation skills. I found helpful tips for 
asking better questions, experimenting, and having new experiences to spark innovation. I adopted many of the authors' 
tips into my daily habits. 

The authors' thesis is that innovators have a core set of attributes that allow them to innovate. 
Innovation often happens through association: bringing together two, sometimes unrelated ideas, to solve
a previously unapplied problem. 

The core innovation habits are questioning, observing, experimenting, and networking. Each of these 
attributes lead the innovator to develop new solutions.

## Innovation Habits

**Questioning**

Ask questions. Lots of questions. Ask questions more than you find answers. Question the status quo 
and dive deep by asking why, why, why. Questions by themselves don't lead to innovation, but they help
us see the world in a new lens. 

"Changing our questions can change the world. The key is constantly creating better questions to see the world 
through new eyes." (IDNA, p. 83)

I found the following tips helpful. 

* Become aware of my question / answer ratio. 
* Be willing to look stupid by consistently asking the questions. 
* Various types of questions: what is, what caused, why, why not, what if [to brainstorm], what if [impose constraint], what if [eliminate constraint].
* Regularly conduct a question-storming session. This is similar to a brainstorm, but you only ask questions. 

**Observing**

Watch people. Watch processes. Look for the job that someone is trying to get done and how they 
are failing or accomplishing it. Look for workarounds, a paper trail, or other indicators that 
a new product could help. 

* Simply people watch. 
* Watch potential customers specific to my product / industry. 

**Experimenting**

Experiment both physically and intellectually. 

Physical boundaries.

* Go to a new country.
* Go to new places. 
* Try a new sport or hobby. 
* Build prototypes
* Take things apart and learn how things work. 

Intellectual boundaries. 

* Learn new things. 
* Read a book / articles outside of your industry. 
* Listen to TED talks. 
* Set an idea quota and regularly brainstorm new ideas. 


**Networking**

Networking isn't so much about meeting people, but rather meeting ideas. 

* Utilize your meal times to get to know new people. 
* Go to conferences
* Form a personal close-knit network of friends to bounce ideas off of. 

## Conclusion

IDNA is a strong buy. Do you have any innovation practices that have helped you?
